# NOTES

- I did **not** use TDD as I was unfamiliar with vue, so I was doing more of an exploration or prototyping with lots of trials and error. So all the tests are written after development, after manually testing the functionality.

# TODO

- instead of `any` in AutoComplete, see if there is any possible way to use type templates on vue components
