# NOTES

- I did **not** use TDD mainly because I was unfamiliar with vue and was doing more of an exploration or prototyping with lots of trials and error. So most of the tests are written after development and manually testing the functionality.

# TODO

- instead of `any` in AutoComplete, see if there is any possible way to use type templates on vue components
- Is it a correct decision to have available options as a state? It does not seem like a wise decision. Check if there is any other workaround
